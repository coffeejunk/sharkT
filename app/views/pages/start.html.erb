    <p>Shark Traits has currently <%= @measurement_count %> measurements of
      <%= @trait_count %> traits, covering <%= @species_count %> species.</p>
    <br>

    <p>The Shark Traits and Shark Trends Databases are an open source research initiative to
    make all published biological traits and population trends on sharks, rays, and chimaeras accessible 
    to everyone. Originally inspired by <a href=https://fishbase.org>FishBase</a>, our databases are modelled after <a href="https://coraltraits.org">Coral Traits database</a> and the <a href="https://www.ramlegacy.org/">RAM legacy database</a>. </p>
    <br>
    <p>The key aspects of our initiative were established with the central tenet of facilitating research on chondrichthyans,
    and are built on three main principles: (1) being completely web-based open-
access and queryable for use by all researchers, (2) quality control and assurance by
experts in the field and traceability of every measurement to its original references, and (3) regular updates 
association with International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List Assessment workshops of focal species.</p>
<br>
<p>Web-based open-access ensures consensus on the data used by researchers and
managers. Data curation is an important component that assures data quality by 
evaluating the confidence in the data by experts. 
To this end we have recruited global leaders on the biology and ecology of
chondrichthyans to synthesize the available information and create a comprehensive
open access resource. Incorporating data entry and updates with the IUCN Shark
Specialist Group’s (SSG) global and regional assessments will also facilitate future
assessments by the IUCN and accuracy of the database. Together, these data will
provide an invaluable and flexible tool understanding chondrichthyan biology and for
managing populations in the face of changing threats across the globe.</p>

<p>An integral part of Shark Traits and Trends is data curation, which is only possible with the work of the following editors:</p>
    <br>
    - Add list of editors and affiliations here (probably photos as well)
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Our databases would not be possible without the countless data contributors:</p>
    <br>
    - Add list of data contributors here (this can probably be done automatically by extracting unique names from the database)
    <br>

    <h3 class="title">Funders</h3>

    <p> Shark Traits and Shark Trends are made possible thanks to the contributions of many donors and funders:</p>
